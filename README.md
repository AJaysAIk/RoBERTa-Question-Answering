This repository contains the implementation of a Question-Answering (QA) system using the RoBERTa transformer model, fine-tuned with the Simple Transformers library. The model is designed to handle complex queries by accurately extracting answers from given contexts. This project demonstrates advanced NLP techniques and showcases the power of transformer models in understanding and processing human language.
